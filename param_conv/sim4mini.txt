To get to Laad Bazaar, you have a few options depending on your preference. If you're up for a little walk and want to soak in the local atmosphere, it's a lovely area to explore on foot. Alternatively, you could take an auto-rickshaw or a cab, which would be a quick and convenient option, especially if you're in a hurry to maximize your time.

You’ll also find some exquisite lacquer bangles with artistic designs. Don't forget to explore a bit beyond bangles; there are also shops selling intricate jewelry and other handicrafts that might catch your eye.

With about 4 hours to spare, after visiting Laad Bazaar, you could also take a short walk to the iconic Charminar, which is just nearby. It’s a historical monument that offers a great photo opportunity and a glimpse into the city’s rich heritage. If you still have time and energy, a visit to the bustling streets around the Charminar can also be delightful, where you can sample some local street food.
