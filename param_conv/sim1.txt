Hyderabad City Guide:
The Salar Jung Museum is a fascinating place to visit with its rich collection of art and artifacts. While I can't provide real-time exhibition details, the museum often showcases a diverse range of exhibitions, including art, historical, cultural, and traditional handicrafts. You can expect to see exquisite pieces from different parts of the world.

While you're there, I recommend starting with the museum's permanent collection, which includes the famous Veiled Rebecca and other remarkable sculptures and paintings. Also, don't miss the galleries dedicated to European and Asian art.

Since you have about 2 hours, you might want to explore the nearby Charminar after your museum visit. It's just a short distance away and offers a glimpse into Hyderabad's rich history. You can also stroll around Laad Bazaar for a quick shopping experience, famous for its bangles and pearls.

The Salar Jung Museum is a treasure trove of historical artifacts and sculptures, making it a perfect destination for your interests. While exhibitions can often rotate, the museum consistently showcases its impressive permanent collection. You should definitely visit the Indian Art section, where you'll find stunning sculptures and artifacts from various Indian dynasties. The European Art section is also noteworthy, featuring magnificent sculptures and paintings.

In terms of current exhibitions, you might find a special display on cultural artifacts or a thematic collection that complements the permanent collection. Since you have about two hours, I suggest focusing on these two sections to make the most of your visit.

After your museum tour, if time allows, visiting the nearby Charminar is a great idea. It's an iconic symbol of Hyderabad and offers a quick yet enriching glimpse into the city's history. Additionally, Laad Bazaar, famous for its bangles and traditional Hyderabadi jewelry, is right around the corner. It could be a delightful way to wrap up your afternoon.
