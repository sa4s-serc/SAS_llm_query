The Qutb Shahi Tombs are a fascinating site, especially Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah's tomb, which is known for its stunning architecture. After you finish exploring the tombs, Golconda Fort is just about 2.5 kilometers away, and you can either walk there (around a 30-minute walk) or take a quick auto-rickshaw ride.

Regarding street food, I recommend checking out the local vendors near the Qutb Shahi Tombs. Look for stalls selling "Biryani," "Pani Puri," and "Mirchi Ka Salan," which are popular local delicacies. I can help you locate the nearest food stalls once you arrive at the tombs.

Now, let me check the current crowd density at the Qutb Shahi Tombs to ensure you have a pleasant experience. Please hold on for a moment.
