Since you're looking for a scenic park with low crowd density, I recommend visiting KBR National Park. Located in Banjara Hills, it's a vast green space with beautiful walking trails, dense forests, and a variety of flora and fauna. The park is less crowded compared to Lumbini Park, making it ideal for a peaceful stroll or a quiet moment in nature.

To get there, you can take a taxi or an auto-rickshaw from your current location. If you're near the city center, it should be a short ride. The park opens early in the morning and is open until sunset, so you can plan your visit accordingly to enjoy the serene atmosphere.

Make sure to carry some water and snacks, as there are limited food options inside the park. If you want, I can also provide suggestions for nearby dining spots after your visit. Enjoy your time exploring the beauty of KBR National Park!
