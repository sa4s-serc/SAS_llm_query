Hi there! I'm really excited to explore Hyderabad during my short visit. I have about 3 hours to spare, and I'm particularly interested in buying local crafts. I've heard that Shilparamam is a fantastic place for that. Could you tell me more about what kinds of crafts I can find there? Are there any specific artisans or stores that are a must-see? Also, how do I get there from here and how much time should I allocate for shopping to ensure I make the most of my visit? Thank you!

Hyderabad City Guide:
Shilparamam is indeed a fantastic choice for local crafts! This arts and crafts village showcases a wide array of traditional handicrafts from across India. You can find exquisite handwoven textiles, intricate wood carvings, ceramic pottery, beautiful jewelry, and much more. Each stall often features the work of skilled artisans, so you're not just buying a product; you're supporting their craft and heritage.

While at Shilparamam, be sure to check out the stalls of local artisans who specialize in handloom products and the famous Bidriware, which is a unique metal handicraft from Hyderabad. If you're lucky, you might even catch live demonstrations of crafts being made, which adds a special touch to your shopping experience.

To get to Shilparamam, if you're in the Hitech City area, it’s quite accessible by auto-rickshaw or cab, which should take you around 15-20 minutes depending on traffic. Allocate about 2 hours for shopping, which gives you ample time to explore the different stalls and perhaps even pick up a few items. This will also allow you some extra time to soak in the atmosphere and enjoy any performances or events that might be happening at the village.

Look for stall number 12, where you can find exquisite scarves and dupattas. For Bidriware, stall number 25 often showcases stunning pieces crafted by skilled artisans. The intricacy of the designs is truly remarkable!

As for live demonstrations, Shilparamam typically hosts them regularly, especially on weekends. You should inquire at the information desk upon arrival; they can provide you with a schedule for the day. It’s a fantastic opportunity to see the artisans at work and learn about their craft firsthand.
