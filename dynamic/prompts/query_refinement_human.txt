Original query: {query}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the query to understand the underlying task or problem.
2. Formulate a clear and specific request for writing a Python function that addresses the general case of the query.
3. Start your refined query with "Write a Python function to" followed by a concise description of the task.
4. If the query involves data from any of the available databases, make sure to mention the use of the appropriate database(s) by their exact names as provided in the database info.
5. If the query might require joining multiple tables or databases, explicitly mention this in your refined query.
6. Focus on creating a reusable function that can handle various inputs, not just the specific example in the query.
7. If the original query is vague, make reasonable assumptions and state them.
8. Ensure the function is general enough to be used in various contexts, not just for the specific instance mentioned in the query.
9. Determine if the query requires database access and state it explicitly.
10. Decide whether the query is more suitable for a GET or POST HTTP method and state your choice.

Output your response in the following format:
Refined query: "Write a Python function to..."
Needs database: [True/False]
Database(s) needed: [List of exact database names, or "None" if no database is needed]
Requires joining tables: [True/False]
HTTP Method: [GET/POST]
