# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide provides solutions to common issues you might encounter while running or developing the IIIT Companion application. If you're experiencing a problem not covered here, please check the project's issue tracker or reach out to the development team.

## Application Won't Start

If the main application fails to start:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Check if the required ports are available and not in use by other applications.

3. Verify that you're in the correct directory and running the command from the project root.

4. Check the console output for any error messages and address them accordingly.

5. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to run the application and access required resources.

## Microservice Connection Issues

If the application can't connect to one or more microservices:

1. Verify that all microservices are running. Check the console output for any error messages during startup.

2. Ensure that the port numbers in `app/config.py` match the actual ports the microservices are running on.

3. Check if there's a firewall blocking the connections between the main app and the microservices.

4. Try restarting the problematic microservice(s) manually:
   ```
   python -m app.microservices.environmental
   ```

5. Verify that the microservice endpoints are correct in the `AppGenerator` class.

## Generated Dashboard Errors

If the generated dashboards are not working correctly:

1. Check the console for any JavaScript errors.

2. Verify that the generated app code is correct by inspecting the generated Python file.

3. Ensure that all required data is being fetched correctly from the microservices.

4. Check if there are any network issues preventing the dashboard from communicating with the microservices.

5. Clear your browser cache and try again, as old JavaScript or CSS might be interfering.

## Performance Issues

If the application is running slowly:

1. Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) to identify bottlenecks.

2. Check if any microservices are overloaded and consider scaling them.

3. Optimize database queries if applicable.

4. Implement caching for frequently accessed data.

5. Use profiling tools to identify slow code paths:
   ```python
   import cProfile
   cProfile.run('run_builder_app()')
   ```

## Import Errors

If you're experiencing import errors:

1. Ensure that you're running the application from the project root directory.

2. Check that all required packages are installed:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Verify that the Python path is set correctly. You may need to add the project root to the PYTHONPATH:
   ```
   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/project/root
   ```

4. Check for circular imports in your code and resolve them.

## Database Connection Issues

If you're using a database and experiencing connection issues:

1. Verify that the database server is running and accessible.

2. Check the database connection string in your configuration file.

3. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the database.

4. Verify that the required database driver is installed.

5. Check for any firewall rules that might be blocking the database connection.

## Authentication Problems

If users are having trouble authenticating:

1. Verify that the authentication service is running and accessible.

2. Check the authentication configuration (e.g., secret keys, token expiration times).

3. Clear browser cookies and cache, then try logging in again.

4. Ensure that the correct authentication endpoints are being used in the frontend.

5. Check server logs for any authentication-related errors.

## Deployment Issues

If you're having trouble deploying the application:

1. Ensure that all environment variables are correctly set in your deployment environment.

2. Verify that all required dependencies are included in your deployment package.

3. Check that the server meets the minimum requirements (Python version, required libraries, etc.).

4. Ensure that file permissions are set correctly on the server.

5. Verify that all necessary ports are open and accessible.

6. Check the server logs for any deployment-related errors.

Remember, if you encounter an issue not covered in this guide, don't hesitate to:

- Check the application logs for more detailed error information.
- Review the project documentation thoroughly.
- Search the project's issue tracker for similar problems and solutions.
- Reach out to the development team or community for support.

By following this troubleshooting guide, you should be able to resolve most common issues with the IIIT Companion application. Always ensure you're using the latest version of the application and its dependencies to avoid known bugs and benefit from the latest features and optimizations.
