Hi there! I'm really interested in visiting the Salar Jung Museum while I'm here in Hyderabad. I've heard so much about its incredible collection. Do they have any special exhibitions going on at the moment? 

Also, since I'm a bit pressed for time — I only have about two hours to spare — are there any specific highlights or must-see items in the museum that you would recommend? 

If there are any local experiences or eateries nearby that I can quickly check out after the museum, I'd love to hear about those too! Thank you!
