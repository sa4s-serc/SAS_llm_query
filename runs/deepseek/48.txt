Hi there! It's fantastic to hear that you're excited to explore Laad Bazaar—it's truly a vibrant place filled with beautiful traditional bangles! 

To reach Laad Bazaar, I recommend taking a cab or using an auto-rickshaw for a quick and comfortable ride. If you're nearby, walking could also be enjoyable, allowing you to soak in the local atmosphere. 

While you're at Laad Bazaar, make sure to look for stalls that specialize in Hyderabadi bangles, particularly the glass bangles that come in a variety of colors and designs. Also, don't miss out on the nearby attractions like the magnificent Charminar, which is just a short walk away and offers a stunning backdrop for your shopping experience. 

If you have time, you might also want to explore the nearby Mecca Masjid, one of the largest mosques in India, and the bustling streets around the bazaar that are perfect for tasting local street food.

Since you only have about 3 hours, I’d suggest you focus on Laad Bazaar and the Charminar area to make the most of your visit. Are you looking for any specific types of bangles or local experiences while you're there? Let me know if you have any dietary preferences if you're interested in trying some local snacks!
