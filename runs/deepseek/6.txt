Durgam Cheruvu is indeed a wonderful choice for a peaceful evening, and it's perfect for leisurely strolls. The lake's serene environment is complemented by beautiful walking trails that allow you to enjoy nature while taking in the lovely surroundings.

For sunset viewing, I recommend heading to the viewpoint near the bridge that crosses the lake. This spot offers stunning views as the sun sets over the water, making it an ideal place for photography. Another great area for capturing photos is along the walking path near the water's edge, where you can get beautiful reflections and scenic shots.

After your walk, you can satisfy your hunger at nearby restaurants. I suggest checking out "The Fisherman's Wharf," which serves delicious seafood and has a lovely ambiance, or "Eat India Company," known for its North Indian and Mughlai cuisine. Both are just a short drive away from Durgam Cheruvu.

As for timings, the area is usually open to visitors throughout the day, but it’s best to visit during the late afternoon to catch the sunset. You can plan to arrive around 5 PM to enjoy your walk and then have dinner afterward.

Enjoy your evening at Durgam Cheruvu and the beautiful sights it has to offer!

I'm thrilled to hear you're excited about visiting Durgam Cheruvu! To make the most of your evening, I recommend arriving at around 5:30 PM. This timing will give you enough time to enjoy a leisurely walk along the scenic paths and find a perfect spot to catch the sunset, which is typically around 6:15 PM.

When you arrive, be sure to explore the walking paths around the lake. There's a lovely pathway that runs along the water's edge, providing stunning views of the sunset and the surrounding greenery. You can also find several benches and lookout points that are ideal for taking photos or simply soaking in the tranquility of the area.

After your peaceful walk, I suggest dining at one of the nearby restaurants that offer great views of the lake. "The Fisherman's Wharf" is a fantastic option, known for its vibrant ambiance and delicious Hyderabadi cuisine, including the iconic Biryani. Another great choice is "Olive Bistro," which offers a continental menu in a beautiful setting overlooking the lake. 

Make sure to check for any reservations, especially if you're visiting during the weekend, as these spots can get busy. Enjoy your evening at Durgam Cheruvu!
