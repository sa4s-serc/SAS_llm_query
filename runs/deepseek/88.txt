The mosque not only offers a glimpse into the city's Islamic heritage but is also a peaceful place to reflect.

Another great attraction is the Qutub Shahi Tombs, located close to both the museum and Mecca Masjid. These tombs are the final resting place of the rulers of the Qutub Shahi dynasty and are surrounded by beautiful gardens, making it a perfect spot to stroll and absorb the history and tranquility of the site.
