Hello! It’s wonderful to hear that you're excited about exploring Hyderabad’s local handicrafts. For your interest, I recommend checking out the following exhibitions:

1. **Shilparamam**: This is an arts and crafts village located in Hitech City, where you can find a variety of handicrafts from different regions of India. They often have exhibitions and workshops showcasing local artisans' work. It’s a great place to see craftsmanship up close.

2. **Lad Bazaar**: This historic market is famous for its bangles and traditional handicrafts. Walking through the bazaar gives you a glimpse of the local culture and offers a chance to buy unique handmade items.

If you have a specific preference for a type of handicraft or if you're interested in attending a workshop or demonstration, please let me know! This will help me narrow down the best options for you within your two-hour timeframe. Enjoy your time in Hyderabad!

It's wonderful to hear that you're excited about exploring local handicrafts in Hyderabad! Shilparamam is indeed an excellent choice for experiencing traditional crafts and art. It often hosts a variety of exhibitions and workshops focused on local handicrafts, including textiles and pottery. I recommend checking their official website or social media for any exhibitions happening in the next couple of hours, as they frequently have events featuring artisans showcasing their skills.

In addition to Shilparamam, you might also want to visit the Numaish Exhibition, which showcases a wide range of handicrafts and textiles from across India. It's an annual event, and depending on the time of your visit, it could offer you unique insights into traditional crafts. Be sure to look for workshops or demonstrations, as they often occur during such exhibitions, allowing you to engage directly with the artists.

If you're looking for a complementary activity, consider visiting the nearby Shankar's International Dolls Museum, where you can appreciate the intricate craftsmanship of doll-making while gaining insight into different cultures through their collections. It’s a lovely way to spend some time and immerse yourself further into the local arts scene.

Enjoy your cultural exploration in Hyderabad, and make the most of these rich experiences!

I'm thrilled to hear you're excited about the local handicraft exhibition! The timings for most handicraft exhibitions in Hyderabad typically run from 10:00 AM to 8:00 PM, giving you ample time to explore throughout the day. However, I recommend checking the specific exhibition schedule closer to your visit, as timings can sometimes vary.

As for ticketing, it's generally a good idea to book your tickets in advance, especially if it's a popular exhibition, as this can help you avoid long lines and ensure entry. You can usually purchase tickets online or at the venue, but securing them ahead of time can make your experience smoother.

Once you're done with the exhibition, consider visiting nearby attractions such as the Salar Jung Museum, which is renowned for its vast collection of art and artifacts, or the Laad Bazaar, famous for its beautiful bangles and traditional handicrafts. Both locations are a short distance away and will provide you with the opportunity to further immerse yourself in the local culture.

Enjoy your time in Hyderabad, and don’t hesitate to ask if you need more assistance or recommendations!
