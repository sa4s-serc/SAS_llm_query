I'm thrilled to hear about your interest in local handicraft exhibitions! Currently, there is a fantastic exhibition titled "Heritage Handicrafts of Telangana" being held at Shilparamam Cultural Society in Hitech City. It runs daily from 11:00 AM to 8:00 PM, and you can easily spend around 2 to 3 hours exploring the various stalls showcasing traditional crafts, artworks, and textiles.

After your visit, I recommend heading to the nearby "N Grill" restaurant for a quick bite. It's known for its delicious South Indian cuisine and offers a lovely ambiance. It's just a 10-minute cab ride from Shilparamam. 

If you're interested in any specific days, I can also check for any upcoming exhibitions that might coincide with your visit. Enjoy immersing yourself in the rich culture and craftsmanship of Hyderabad!
