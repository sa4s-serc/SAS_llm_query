Also, are there any particular dishes or stalls that I shouldn’t miss during my short visit? Thank you!

That sounds like a delicious adventure! For your street food exploration in Hyderabad, you can start your day around **5 PM** when the stalls begin to set up for the evening rush. 

1. **Jubilee Hills**: A lively area, you can find various stalls offering **Pani Puri** and **Bhel Puri** on the streets near the **Jubilee Hills Check Post**. Make sure to spend about an hour here to really soak in the flavors and ambiance.

2. **Banjara Hills**: After Jubilee Hills, head over to Banjara Hills, which is just a 10-15 minute auto-rickshaw ride away. You can find vendors around **Road No. 12**, and I recommend trying **Dahi Puri**. Allocate another hour for this area as it can get quite busy.

3. **Mohammed Nagar**: If you still have time, you can visit Mohammed Nagar around **7 PM**. It's known for its creative street snacks; spend about 45 minutes here for a unique culinary experience.

4. **Gulshan-e-Iqbal Park**: After indulging in street food, you can relax at Gulshan-e-Iqbal Park, which is nearby and perfect for a leisurely stroll. Aim to arrive by **8 PM**, and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere while digesting all those tasty treats.

For transportation, I recommend using **auto-rickshaws** for short distances as they are convenient and provide a local experience. If you need assistance in finding the best routes or options, just let me know! Enjoy your food journey in Hyderabad!
