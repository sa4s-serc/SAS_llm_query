While you're at Hussain Sagar Lake, I recommend starting your visit around 5:00 PM when the weather is cooler and the views are stunning. Here are a couple of activities you can enjoy:

1. **Boat Ride to the Buddha Statue:** Take a boat ride to the iconic Buddha statue in the middle of the lake. The boat rides typically operate from 10:30 AM to 9:00 PM, so you can easily catch one around 5:30 PM. The ride lasts about 30 minutes, allowing you to appreciate the beauty of the lake and the surrounding skyline.

2. **Lumbini Park:** After your boat ride, you can head to Lumbini Park, which is adjacent to the lake. The park is open until 9:00 PM, and you can spend some time walking around, enjoying the greenery, or simply relaxing by the lakeside. It's a perfect spot to unwind after your boat ride.

Additionally, there are plenty of food stalls and restaurants nearby where you can grab dinner afterward. I recommend trying some local Hyderabadi cuisine, like biryani or kebabs, to complete your experience.

Enjoy your evening at Hussain Sagar Lake, and feel free to reach out if you need help with transportation options or any other information!
