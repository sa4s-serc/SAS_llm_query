I'm thrilled to hear that you're excited about visiting Ramoji Film City! The film sets and behind-the-scenes tours are indeed a highlight of the experience. Typically, these tours can take around 2-3 hours, which fits perfectly into your time frame. I recommend not missing the "Film City Studio" where you can see various sets used in popular movies, and the "Action Studio," which showcases stunt performances and special effects.

Regarding ticket purchases, it's highly advisable to buy tickets in advance online. This not only guarantees your entry but can also save you time on site, allowing you to jump straight into the attractions. 

If you find you have a little extra time after exploring Ramoji Film City, consider visiting the nearby "Nehru Outer Ring Road" for a beautiful drive or a scenic spot to relax. Additionally, you can grab a quick bite at "Aaswad" in the vicinity, which is known for its authentic South Indian cuisine, perfect for a delicious yet swift meal. 

Enjoy your visit, and make sure to take plenty of pictures!
