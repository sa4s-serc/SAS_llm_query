It's wonderful to hear about your excitement for exploring Hyderabad and your interest in photography exhibitions! 

Firstly, regarding the Telangana State Art Gallery, they often feature works from local photographers and themes that resonate with Hyderabad's vibrant culture. Currently, they have an exhibition showcasing contemporary photography that highlights local artists and their perspectives on modern life in the city. This could be a fantastic opportunity for you to explore and capture some stunning visuals.

Additionally, I recommend visiting the Salar Jung Museum, which indeed has a collection of photographs along with its extensive artifacts. They currently have an exhibition that focuses on historical photography, showcasing the evolution of the art form and its significance in documenting Hyderabad's rich heritage. This could provide a great contrast to the contemporary themes at the Telangana State Art Gallery.

For a complementary activity, consider taking a stroll around the nearby Charminar, which is not only an iconic landmark but also a great spot for street photography. The bustling markets around Laad Bazaar are full of vibrant colors and lively scenes that would be perfect for your photography collection.

I hope these suggestions enhance your experience in Hyderabad and help you discover some fantastic photography! Enjoy your visit!
