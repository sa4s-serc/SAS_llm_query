Hi there! I’m really interested in visiting the Salar Jung Museum. I’ve heard it has an incredible collection of art and artifacts. Do they have any special exhibitions going on right now? I’d love to make the most of my visit.  

Since I only have about three hours to spare, are there any specific local experiences or must-see exhibits you would recommend? I want to soak in as much of the culture and history as I can during my short time here. Thank you!

In the meantime, since you have about three hours, I recommend focusing on a couple of key experiences to make the most of your visit:
