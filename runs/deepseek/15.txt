Hi there! It's fantastic that you're eager to explore the street food scene in Hyderabad! I recommend visiting the following areas, which are famous for their delicious chaat and local snacks:

1. **Laad Bazaar**: Known for its vibrant atmosphere, Laad Bazaar offers a variety of street food options, including classic chaat items like Pani Puri, Bhel Puri, and Dahi Puri. You can enjoy the bustling market while trying out these delightful snacks.

2. **Jubilee Hills**: This area has a mix of upscale eateries and local street food stalls. Don't miss trying the famous 'Pav Bhaji' and 'Sev Puri' from the street vendors here. It's a great place to enjoy food in a lively setting.

3. **Shah Ghouse Cafe**: Located in the old city, this cafe is renowned for its Irani tea and local snacks like 'Mirchi Ka Salan' and 'Haleem' during the season. Though not strictly street food, it offers an authentic local experience.

If you have any specific preferences for types of chaat or snacks, let me know, and I can provide more tailored recommendations! Enjoy your culinary adventure in Hyderabad!

If you're looking to dive into the vibrant street food scene of Hyderabad, I highly recommend starting your food journey at **Chaat Bandaar** in the bustling area of **Jubilee Hills**. They are well-known for their mouth-watering paani puri and bhel puri! Have you ever tried these before? 

Another fantastic spot is **Gokul Chaat**, located near **Himayat Nagar**. They have an amazing selection of chaat items like dahi puri and aloo chaat that will leave you craving for more. Are you a fan of spicy food, or do you prefer milder flavors?

If you have a sweet tooth, don't miss out on the **Falooda** at **Shah Ghouse**. It's a delightful dessert drink that combines rose syrup, vermicelli, and ice cream – perfect for cooling down after all the chaat. Does that sound tempting to you?

Since you only have three hours, I suggest starting at one place and then moving to another nearby location to make the most of your time. Would you like tips on how to navigate between these areas, or perhaps advice on the best times to visit to avoid crowds? Let me know how else I can help you explore the delicious street food of Hyderabad!
