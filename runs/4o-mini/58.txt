I'm glad to hear you're excited about visiting the Qutub Shahi Tombs! These tombs are indeed a stunning example of Indo-Islamic architecture and offer a serene atmosphere that's perfect for exploration and photography. 

Given that you have 2 hours, I recommend you start your visit early in the morning or late in the afternoon. This timing will provide you with softer natural light for photography, enhancing the intricate details of the architecture and the surrounding gardens. The golden hour, just after sunrise or before sunset, is particularly beautiful for capturing stunning shots.

After your visit, I suggest heading to a nearby restaurant to enjoy some authentic local cuisine. Here are two great options:

1. **Shah Ghouse Cafe** - Known for its delicious Hyderabadi biryani and kebabs, this cafe is a local favorite and offers a genuine taste of the region's culinary heritage.

2. **Hotel Shadab** - Another popular spot, Hotel Shadab serves a variety of Hyderabadi dishes, including their famous haleem and biryani. It's a cozy place where you can unwind after your exploration.

Both of these restaurants are not too far from the Qutub Shahi Tombs, making for a convenient stop after your visit. Enjoy your time in Hyderabad, and don't forget to take lots of photos!
