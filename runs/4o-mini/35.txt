It sounds like you're keen on exploring photography exhibitions and galleries during your short stay in Hyderabad! I'm excited to help you make the most of your time.

This week, I recommend visiting the Salar Jung Museum, which has a fantastic collection of art, including photography exhibitions. It's a historical museum, so you'll also get a glimpse into the rich heritage of Hyderabad while you're there. You might also want to check out the State Gallery of Art, which often features contemporary photography and artworks.

To make sure you have ample time for both locations, I suggest starting with the Salar Jung Museum first, as it opens at 10 AM, and aim to spend about an hour there. Then, head over to the State Gallery of Art, which is not too far away, for another hour of exploration.

Are you okay with this timing? Do you need any recommendations for nearby restaurants to grab a quick bite before or after your visits? I’m really looking forward to hearing about your experiences!

I'm thrilled you're interested in photography exhibitions while you're in Hyderabad! Here's a detailed plan for your day:

1. **Salar Jung Museum**: Start your day by visiting the Salar Jung Museum, which opens at **10 AM**. This museum showcases a rich collection of art, including photography exhibitions, and it will take you about **1 hour** to explore. Make sure to arrive on time to enjoy the exhibits without feeling rushed.

2. **State Gallery of Art**: After your visit to the Salar Jung Museum, head over to the nearby State Gallery of Art, which is approximately a **15-20 minute drive** away. You can expect to spend another **1 hour** here, delving into contemporary photography and artwork. 

To ensure a smooth transition between the two locations, plan to leave the Salar Jung Museum by **11:15 AM**, and you should arrive at the State Gallery of Art by **11:45 AM**. This allows you to have enough time to experience both places thoroughly.

If you're looking for a nearby restaurant for a quick bite, I recommend **Bawarchi** for some authentic Hyderabadi biryani or **Chutney's** for delicious South Indian fare, both located conveniently near your route.
