Hey there! I'm thrilled to hear about your excitement for exploring the street food scene in Hyderabad! You're right; **Jubilee Hills** and **Madhapur** are fantastic spots for vibrant street food culture, especially for chaat.

In Jubilee Hills, **Chaat Bandaar** is a must-visit. It has a lively atmosphere filled with locals and tourists enjoying the delicious offerings. The vibe is very energetic, especially during the evenings, and it can get quite crowded, so be prepared for a bit of a wait! Their **Pani Puri** is particularly popular, and you won't be disappointed with the flavor.

As for **Bhel Puri**, you should also check out **Chaat House** nearby, which is known for its crispy and tangy Bhel. It's a favorite spot among street food lovers.

If you still have some time after indulging in chaat, I recommend trying **Dahi Puri** from a nearby vendor. You could also visit **Madhapur** and head to **Chutney's**, where you can find a variety of local snacks like **Mirchi Ka Salan** and **Pesarattu**. These are traditional dishes that complement the street food experience perfectly.
