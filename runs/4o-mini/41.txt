Nearby, I recommend heading to the Durgam Cheruvu Park, which is just a short distance away.

Since you have around three hours to spare, I recommend the following plan to make the most of your visit to Gandipet Lake.

First, I suggest you start with a quick bite at a nearby restaurant. You can visit a popular spot like "Cafe Coffee Day" or "The Fisherman's Wharf" which offers a scenic view and serves a variety of cuisines. Plan to spend about 30-45 minutes here enjoying your meal.

After your meal, you can head to Gandipet Lake. It usually takes about 20-30 minutes to reach the lake from the restaurant, depending on traffic. Once you arrive, you can spend the remaining time exploring the beautiful surroundings. Here are two specific activities you can enjoy:

1. **Boating**: You can rent a paddle boat or a rowboat to enjoy a peaceful ride on the water. This typically lasts around 30-45 minutes and allows you to soak in the stunning views of the lake and the surrounding hills.

2. **Nature Walk**: After boating, take a leisurely stroll along the walking paths around the lake. This will give you a chance to appreciate the natural beauty and perhaps spot some local wildlife. You can spend about 30-45 minutes walking and taking photos.

In summary, here's a breakdown of your time:
- **Restaurant**: 30-45 minutes
- **Travel to Gandipet Lake**: 20-30 minutes
- **Boating**: 30-45 minutes
- **Nature Walk**: 30-45 minutes

Make sure to check the weather before heading out, and it's a good idea to carry some water and snacks if you prefer not to rely solely on the restaurant. Enjoy your visit to Gandipet Lake!
