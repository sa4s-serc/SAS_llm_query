I'm thrilled to hear you're excited about visiting the Qutub Shahi Tombs! They are indeed a stunning historical site, showcasing beautiful architecture and rich culture. 

For transportation, I recommend using a private transport option or a cab for convenience, especially since you have a limited time of 4 hours. This way, you can reach the tombs comfortably and quickly. You can also consider using an auto-rickshaw for a more local experience, but be sure to agree on a fare beforehand.

Regarding guided tours, there are often local guides available at the entrance of the Qutub Shahi Tombs. Opting for a guided tour will enrich your experience as they provide detailed insights into the history and significance of the site. You can also check online for any pre-arranged guided tours that can be booked in advance.

Within the tomb complex, some must-see spots for photography include the mausoleum of Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, which is known for its intricate carvings and grand dome, and the beautiful gardens surrounding the tombs. The juxtaposition of the tombs against the lush greenery provides terrific photo opportunities.

For purchasing tickets, you can typically buy them at the entrance. However, to avoid delays, consider checking if online tickets are available through official websites or local tourism boards. This will save you time and give you peace of mind.

Additionally, if time permits, you might want to visit the nearby Mecca Masjid, one of the largest mosques in India, or explore the vibrant Laad Bazaar, famous for its bangles and local handicrafts. Both of these sites are close to the tombs and will enhance your experience in Hyderabad.

Enjoy your visit to the Qutub Shahi Tombs and the beautiful moments you'll capture there!
