It sounds like you're ready for an exciting shopping adventure in Hyderabad! Starting at Laad Bazaar is a fantastic idea as it is vibrant and filled with colorful bangles. I recommend spending about 1.5 to 2 hours here. You can explore the stalls, interact with the vendors, and find those perfect souvenirs. 

After Laad Bazaar, we can head to Sultan Bazaar, which is known for its local shopping and street food. It's a great spot to indulge in some Irani chai and Osmania biscuits. You should allocate around 1 to 1.5 hours for Sultan Bazaar. This will give you enough time to soak in the atmosphere, enjoy some bites, and maybe even discover some unique items.

As for logistics, both markets are relatively close to each other, making it convenient to walk between them. If you prefer, we can also get an auto-rickshaw for a fun ride. Just let me know what you prefer, and I'm excited for you to experience this lively atmosphere!
