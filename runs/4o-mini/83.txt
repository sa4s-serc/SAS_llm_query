Since you're planning to spend time near Hussain Sagar Lake, I recommend visiting the lake in the late afternoon, around 4 PM, when the weather is pleasant and the sunset views are spectacular. You can start with a leisurely stroll along the promenade, which typically takes about an hour. 

After your walk, consider taking a boat ride to see the iconic Buddha statue, which usually lasts about 30 minutes. The last boat rides typically run until 7 PM, so plan accordingly.

For dining, there are several great eateries nearby. You might want to check out "Eat India Company," known for its delicious North Indian cuisine, or if you're in the mood for something lighter, "Waterfront Restaurant" offers a lovely ambiance with a variety of snacks and beverages. It's best to make reservations, especially during weekends, to ensure you have a spot with a view.

Enjoy your visit to Hussain Sagar Lake, and if you need further assistance or recommendations, feel free to ask!
