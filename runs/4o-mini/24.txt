Given that you have about 2 hours to spare, I recommend visiting Gandipet Lake in the late afternoon, ideally around 4 PM. This time will allow you to enjoy the beautiful sunset views, making the experience even more memorable.

Before or after your visit to the lake, you can check the water quality to ensure it's suitable for any activities you may want to do, like boating. I can gather the latest updates on the water quality for you if you'd like.

For a quick bite to eat while enjoying the scenic beauty of the lake, I suggest visiting a nearby eatery that offers local Hyderabadi cuisine. One popular option is the "Gandipet Lake View Restaurant," which not only serves delicious food but also provides a lovely view of the lake. 

Make sure to plan your time accordingly—spend about an hour at the lake and another hour at the restaurant to unwind and enjoy your meal. Don't forget to take some great photos to capture the beauty of the area! Enjoy your visit!
