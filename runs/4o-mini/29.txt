I'm glad to hear you're excited about spending time near Hussain Sagar Lake! It's indeed a beautiful area. To address your concerns about water quality, currently, the water quality in Hussain Sagar is under regular monitoring. While it can vary, you can expect some areas to be cleaner than others. A good spot to enjoy relatively better water quality is near the Lumbini Park area, where you can also enjoy scenic views.

Taking a boat ride to get closer to the Buddha statue is a fantastic idea! It's a popular activity and offers an excellent perspective of the statue and the surrounding landscape. You can find various boat service options at the jetty near Lumbini Park.

After your boat ride, I recommend visiting a nearby café or park to relax. You could check out the Necklace Road, which is a lovely promenade along the lake, perfect for a leisurely walk or enjoying a meal at one of the cafes with a view of the lake. Alternatively, you can visit the nearby Sanjeevaiah Park, which is great for a peaceful stroll amidst greenery.

Enjoy your time at Hussain Sagar Lake, and make the most of your 4 hours exploring this beautiful area!
