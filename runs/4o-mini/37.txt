Is there anything interesting coming up in that regard? I’m particularly interested in traditional crafts like Bidri work, Kalamkari, or even the famous Hyderabadi pearls.  

Also, since I only have about 3 hours to explore, could you recommend any specific places or events that I should check out? I'm eager to immerse myself in the local culture and make the most of my time here! Thank you!

I'm thrilled to hear that you're excited about exploring the local handicraft exhibitions in Hyderabad! Typically, handicraft exhibitions in the city are held from around 10:00 AM to 8:00 PM, allowing you ample time to browse and appreciate the vibrant culture. 

Regarding ticket purchases, it's often best to buy tickets at the venue, as many exhibitions do not require advance booking. However, if there are specific popular exhibitions or events, it's a good idea to check online a day or two before your visit, just to ensure there are no sell-outs or special entry requirements.

Make sure to also check out the local food stalls at the exhibitions where you can try some delicious street food, enhancing your overall experience. Enjoy your time in Hyderabad, and feel free to ask if you need more information!
