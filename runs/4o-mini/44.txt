At the Salar Jung Museum, they often feature special exhibitions on traditional Indian art, with a focus on various regional styles. Currently, they have an exhibition highlighting the intricate art of Bidriware, a traditional metal handicraft known for its unique inlay work. This exhibition brings together works that showcase the skill and artistry of this craft. While you're there, be sure to explore their vast collection of artifacts, including the famous Veiled Rebecca statue, which is a must-see!

Just a short distance away is the Shrishti Art Gallery, renowned for promoting local artists and their traditional works. Currently, they are showcasing a group exhibition titled "Heritage Reimagined," which features the works of several local artists who reinterpret traditional themes through contemporary expressions. Look out for pieces by artist Anjali Sinha, who beautifully captures the essence of traditional Indian motifs in her paintings.

To complement your visit, consider taking a leisurely stroll at Lumbini Park, which is nearby. It offers a serene environment where you can relax and enjoy views of Hussain Sagar Lake. You can also catch a glimpse of the iconic Buddha statue situated in the middle of the lake. 

With these activities, you can immerse yourself in the traditional art forms of Hyderabad while enjoying the beautiful surroundings. Enjoy your cultural journey!
