Absolutely! I’m thrilled to help you explore the vibrant handicraft scene in Hyderabad. 

Firstly, at **Shilparamam**, you can indeed witness a fantastic display of traditional crafts. They often host exhibitions featuring local artisans. Currently, there is a **Handicrafts Exhibition** showcasing various forms of crafts including pottery, weaving, and woodwork. You might want to check the schedule for any specific events happening during your visit, as they frequently hold workshops where you can see artisans at work and even participate!

Nearby, I recommend visiting **Laad Bazaar**, which is just a short distance away from Shilparamam. This bustling market is famous for its bangles, traditional jewelry, and other handicrafts. It’s a great place to experience the local culture and shop for unique souvenirs.

Additionally, the **Salar Jung Museum** is an excellent choice for your interest in textiles and sculptures. The museum houses an impressive collection of artifacts, including intricate textiles and beautiful sculptures from various regions. Make sure to check out their **Handicrafts Exhibition**, which features a variety of crafts including historical textiles and stunning sculptures that reflect the rich heritage of the region.

If you have time, don’t miss exploring **Numaish**, an annual exhibition that might be happening during your visit, showcasing diverse crafts, textiles, and food from across India. 

With these suggestions, you’ll have a fantastic time immersing yourself in Hyderabad’s rich handicraft culture! Enjoy your exploration!

I'm thrilled to help you immerse yourself in the local culture of Hyderabad! Here are a couple of exciting exhibitions happening in the next few hours that you should definitely check out:

1. **Handicrafts Exhibition** at Shilparamam: This exhibition showcases traditional handicrafts from across India, including intricate textiles, pottery, and jewelry. It's open until 8:00 PM, and you can spend about 1.5 to 2 hours here. 

2. **Art Exhibition** at the Salar Jung Museum: This museum features a splendid collection of art and artifacts. The exhibition is open until 7:00 PM. You can plan to spend around 1.5 hours exploring the impressive displays.

Given your 4-hour window, visiting both places is feasible if you start with the handicrafts exhibition at Shilparamam and then head over to the Salar Jung Museum.

For a quick bite nearby, you can try:

- **Chutneys** (near Shilparamam): Known for its delicious South Indian cuisine, you can grab a quick meal here. They close around 10:30 PM, so you'll have plenty of time. 
- **Bawarchi** (near Salar Jung Museum): Famous for its biryanis, this restaurant is a great spot for a hearty meal. It also stays open until 11:00 PM.

I recommend starting with Shilparamam around 4:00 PM, then heading to the Salar Jung Museum around 6:00 PM. After your museum visit, you can stop for dinner at either Chutneys or Bawarchi. 

Enjoy your time in Hyderabad, and let me know if you need any further assistance!
