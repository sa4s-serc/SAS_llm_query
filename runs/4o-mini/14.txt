Hi there! I’m visiting Hyderabad and I have about 5 hours to spare. I would love to see some local handicraft exhibitions. Is there anything interesting coming up that showcases the local craftsmanship? I’m particularly interested in traditional crafts, textiles, and maybe even some unique souvenirs I can take back home. Are there specific places or events I should look out for during my short visit? Thank you!

I'm thrilled to hear about your excitement for the handicrafts of Hyderabad! One exhibition you should prioritize is the "Hyderabad Handicrafts Expo," which is currently being held at the Shilparamam Arts and Crafts Village. This exhibition showcases a wide variety of local handicrafts, including textiles, pottery, and jewelry. The timings are from 11:00 AM to 8:00 PM, so you have plenty of time to explore!

It's advisable to book your tickets in advance, which can be done online through their official website or at the venue itself. Tickets typically cost around ₹50 for adults, and children can enter for free.

To make the most of your time, I recommend using public transport, as it is convenient and economical. The Hyderabad Metro is a great option, especially to reach Shilparamam, as there’s a nearby metro station. You can also consider booking a cab for a more direct route if you’re short on time.

Enjoy your visit, and don't hesitate to ask if you need more information on attractions or transportation!
