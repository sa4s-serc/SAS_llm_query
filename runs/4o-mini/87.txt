Hello! I'm thrilled to hear about your interest in traditional art in Hyderabad. You're in for a treat as the city has a rich cultural heritage.

First, let's talk about the **Salar Jung Museum**. This museum is renowned for its extensive collection of artifacts and artworks. Currently, there are exhibitions featuring various traditional art forms. Be sure to look out for the intricate collections of Persian and Mughal art, as well as the famous “Veiled Rebecca” sculpture, which is a highlight of the museum. It's a fantastic place to immerse yourself in history and artistry.

As for **Shilparamam Arts and Crafts Village**, it's a vibrant hub for traditional arts and crafts. They regularly host workshops and exhibitions focusing on local artisans and their crafts. Right now, there might be workshops where you can learn about traditional painting techniques or pottery. Engaging in a workshop will not only enhance your understanding of the art but also give you a hands-on experience.

To complement your visit, I recommend checking out the **Lad Bazaar**, which is nearby both the Salar Jung Museum and Shilparamam. It's famous for its traditional bangles and handicrafts. Strolling through the market will give you a taste of the local culture and the opportunity to pick up unique souvenirs.

Make sure to check the current schedules for exhibitions and workshops at both locations to make the most of your visit. Enjoy your exploration of Hyderabad's traditional art scene!
