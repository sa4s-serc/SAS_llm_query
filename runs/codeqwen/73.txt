As a fellow Hyderabadite, I am also a big fan of Biryani and I would highly recommend trying out the famous Qutub Shahi Tomb Biryani at Qutub Shahi Tombs. The place offers an excellent selection of vegetarian biryani options and is located in the heart of the city. It's a must-visit destination for anyone interested in trying authentic Hyderabadi biryani.

In terms of my personal preferences, I prefer traditional Biryani over non-traditional ones. However, I don't mind trying out new things, so feel free to recommend any other vegetarian biryani spot you think would be worth exploring.
