Hello! As an AI language model, I understand that you have three hours to explore Hyderabad and want to visit Hussain Sagar Lake for some refreshing water. It's great that you're interested in exploring the lake and taking advantage of your time limit.

Hussain Sagar Lake is one of the most popular waterfalls in India, located in the city of Hyderabad. The water is known for its crystal-clear blue color and is believed to originate from the Hussain Sagar River, which flows through the heart of the city.

As for the water quality at Hussain Sagar Lake, it is believed to be quite clean and fresh. However, it's always best to check the water quality before going on a hike or swimming in the lake. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Look for signs of contamination such as rust stains, algae, or dead fish.
2. Check the pH level of the water to ensure it falls within safe drinking range (usually between 6.5 and 7.5).
3. Drink a sample of the water to see if it has any harmful bacteria or toxins.

Overall, Hussain Sagar Lake is a beautiful place to take a relaxing walk or swim, but it's important to take precautions to ensure your safety and health. Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
