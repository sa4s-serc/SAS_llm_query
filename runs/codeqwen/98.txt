Hello there! As a first-time traveler to Hyderabad, I'm eager to discover some of the best things to do, see, and eat around here. With only two hours to spare, I'll do my best to make the most of my visit. Based on my knowledge of the city, I recommend visiting the Golconda Fort, which is known for its impressive architecture and stunning views of the city skyline. Additionally, if you prefer to explore the city's culture, I recommend visiting the Qutub Shahi Tombs, where you can learn about the history of the city and its religious significance. Lastly, don't forget to indulge in some delicious Hyderabadi cuisine at a local restaurant, such as Saffron Biryani or Kebabs. With these suggestions, I hope you'll enjoy your trip to Hyderabad!
