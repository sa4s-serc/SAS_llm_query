Sure, let me suggest some places that serve traditional Iranian chai and Osmania biscuits! Firstly, I would recommend visiting the Golconda Fort, which is known for its impressive architecture and rich history. This ancient fortress has several temples and mosques, including the Qutub Shahi Tombs, which holds the remains of the tomb of Prophet Muhammad. Additionally, the Golconda Fort is home to the Salar Jung Museum, which showcases the architectural masterpieces of the city. For those who prefer a more relaxed atmosphere, the Banjara Hills National Park is a great option, featuring lush green forests, wildlife, and scenic views. Lastly, the GVK One Mall is a must-visit destination, offering a wide range of shopping, dining, and entertainment options. Enjoy your trip to Hyderabad with these delicious dishes!
