2. Explore the Qutub Shahi Tombs - These ancient tombs were once the burial sites of the Qutub family, who ruled the Mughal Empire from 1526 to 1557. They are now a UNESCO World Heritage Site and offer stunning views of the surrounding gardens and temples. You can either go on foot or hire a guide to explore these historic sites.
