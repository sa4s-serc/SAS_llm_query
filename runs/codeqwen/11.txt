Hello! I'm excited to spend my three hours exploring Hyderabad and enjoying the beautiful sunset at Tank Bund. Do you have any recommendations for other places to visit during this time, or any interesting local experiences? Also, do you know if the evening crowds at Tank Bund are typical or do they tend to be more lively?

Guide:
Would love to enjoy the sunset at Tank Bund. Is it usually very crowded in the evenings?
If yes, suggest two other popular places to visit around Tank Bund, such as Golconda Fort or Charminar. If not, suggest two more lesser-known places to explore, like the Hussain Sagar Lake or the Birla Mandir.
