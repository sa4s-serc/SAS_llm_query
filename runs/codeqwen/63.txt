As an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time information about whether GVK One is crowded on weekdays or not. However, I can suggest that you consider visiting the Golconda Fort and the Tank Bund during off-peak hours or on weekends to avoid crowds. Additionally, you might want to plan your visit to the Laad Bazaar and Birla Mandir during peak hours when there may be fewer crowds.

Regarding the special events at the GVK One Mall, you can ask your guide if there are any upcoming events during the weekdays that you should be aware of. They can also recommend any nearby restaurants, hotels, or shopping options that you may not have heard of before.

In terms of timing and logistics, you can let your guide know how long you have left to travel to Hyderabad and how far away you are from the mall. They can also help you figure out the best way to get there, such as taking a bus or train. Finally, you can confirm your plans with your guide and let them know how much time you have to spend at the mall and what you would like to do there.
