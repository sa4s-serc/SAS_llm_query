Hello! It's nice to meet you. I'm excited to take you on a tour of Hyderabad. As an AI, I don't have personal experiences, but I can tell you about the area and its natural beauty. 

Hussain Sagar Lake is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Hyderabad. The lake is known for its crystal clear water that has been filtered over centuries to ensure its quality. However, due to the ongoing construction works at the lake, the water may not be as fresh as it used to be. 

To make the most of your time near Hussain Sagar Lake, I suggest taking a boat ride or exploring the surrounding areas. You can also visit some of the local attractions like the Charminar and the Qutub Minar. 

Remember, your 2 hours time constraint should allow you to enjoy this beautiful place to the fullest. Let me know if you need any further assistance or information.
